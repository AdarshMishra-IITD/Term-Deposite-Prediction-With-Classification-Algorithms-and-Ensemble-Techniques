# Term_Deposite_Prediction_With_Ensemble_Techniques
Objective: To predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit. Data collected from Machine Learning Repository(UCI) \
Methodology & Results: 
1. Performed EDA with various Statistical and Visualization tools. 
2. Used MICE for handling missing values and SMOTE for oversampling. 
3. Used standard ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree) with hyperparameter tuning.
4. Used ensembled learning models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting).
5. Got accuracy in range (83-90%) & F1-score(65-69%) Random Forest performed best. Balancing rose them to 97%, 90% respectivily.
